## OpenCV for Robotic Vision

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source library designed for real-time image and video processing. It enables machines to interpret visual information from the environment, effectively allowing computers and robots to **“see” and analyze the world around them**.

In robotics, OpenCV functions as the **perception layer**—the robot’s eyes 👀—by converting raw camera data into meaningful information that can be used for decision-making and control.

### Applications of OpenCV in Robotics

Some of the most common robot vision tasks implemented using OpenCV include:

* **Obstacle detection and avoidance**
* **Face and object recognition**
* **Colour-based object detection**
* **Line following and path tracking**
* **Gesture and motion analysis**

## Image Representation in OpenCV

In OpenCV, an image is stored as a **NumPy array**.

* Each image consists of **rows (height)** and **columns (width)**.
* Every pixel is represented by **three intensity values**, corresponding to colour channels.
* Unlike the conventional RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format, **OpenCV stores colour images in BGR (Blue, Green, Red) order**.
  This design choice optimizes performance and compatibility with certain imaging hardware.

Understanding this representation is crucial for correct image processing and colour manipulation.

## Sample Project: Real-Time Colour Object Detection and Tracking

### Objective

To detect a specific coloured object (e.g., a blue bottle or red ball) using OpenCV and track its position in real time through a webcam feed.

### Working Principle

1. Capture live video frames from the webcam.
2. Convert the image from **BGR to HSV colour space**, which is more robust to lighting variations.
3. Apply colour thresholding to isolate the desired object.
4. Reduce noise using morphological operations.
5. Detect contours and identify the largest object.
6. Draw a bounding box and mark the object’s center.

### Implementation (Python + OpenCV)

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Open camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Convert BGR to HSV
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

    # Define color range (BLUE object)
    lower_blue = np.array([100, 150, 50])
    upper_blue = np.array([140, 255, 255])

    # Create mask
    mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)

    # Remove noise using erosion and dilation
    mask = cv2.erode(mask, None, iterations=2)
    mask = cv2.dilate(mask, None, iterations=2)

    # Find contours
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    if contours:
        largest = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)
        area = cv2.contourArea(largest)

        if area > 500:
            x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(largest)

            # Draw bounding box
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

            # Calculate center of object
            cx = x + w // 2
            cy = y + h // 2
            cv2.circle(frame, (cx, cy), 5, (0, 0, 255), -1)

            cv2.putText(frame, "Object Detected", (x, y-10),
                        cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display results
    cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)
    cv2.imshow("Mask", mask)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == 27:  # ESC key
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
